# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! This web application allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, helping you understand how they work and compare their performance.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and more.
- **Code Available:** The source code for each sorting algorithm is available, making it easy to understand and implement them in your own projects.
- **Colorful Visualization:** Watch as the array elements move and change color in real-time, providing a dynamic representation of the sorting process.
- **Algorithm Information:** Get information about each sorting algorithm, including its time complexity, space complexity, and key characteristics.

## How to Use

1. **Choose Sorting Algorithm:** Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. **Visualize Sorting:** Click the "Visualize" button to start the visualization.
3. **Reset:** To reset the array and start over, click the "Reset" button.
